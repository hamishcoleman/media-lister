With the goal of watching recorded TV and Movies, I find it annoying
that the computer doesnt remember which files I have already watched.
I used to solve this with XBMC/Kodi, but recently it has been flakey.

This repository contains a small, simple media discovery and listing
program that will mark the files with seen/unseen.

Keys:
-----
q               Quit
w               Toggle the watched/unwatched state for the file under
                the cursor
Left and Enter  Play the file or descend into the subdirectory
Right           Return to the previous subdirectory


It will automatically store a log of the changes to the watched/unwatched
status in ~/.cache/media-lister/seenlog and will replay this log on
startup.

While it is a working system, the following features would be nice:
- persist the "__last_pos" cache from the HC::Curses::UI::Listbox::Object
- if there is no __last_pos cache, but there are watched files,
  position the cursor on the first unwatched file
- use the seenlog as a source of directories for "Recently Watched"
    - bonus points for removing directories that have no unwatched files
