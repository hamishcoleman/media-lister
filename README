With the goal of watching recorded TV and Movies, I find it annoying that the
computer doesnt remember which files I have already watched.  I used to solve
this with XBMC/Kodi, but recently it has been flakey.

This repository contains a small, simple media discovery and listing program
that will mark the files with seen/unseen and help finding the next unseen
file.
